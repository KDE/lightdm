File format as follows:
in /usr/share/lightdm-kde/

themename/
  desktop.rc
  Preview.png(or live preview?)
     -live preview, fake QML entires. Easily do-able, would be good for testing
  main.qml
  config.kcfg
  config.ui

The latter two will be used in the KCM to get per-theme options.
This will save having two rebuild an entire theme each time just to change the background. Also avoids the problem of having a UI which shows options which don't do anything. Both being things that realy suck in KDM.

Context Properties:
  powerInterface
  screenSize
  greeter
  usersModel
  sessionsModel

(Fixme? Alternately could expose this as objects which can be created, may make more sense for the models)
